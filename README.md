[05/02, 14:35] Nipun Goyal Sir: @⁨Anirudh algo⁩ @⁨Harsh Porwal⁩ 

I want you both to help me with next assignment preparation.

It would be something like , we provide them with a backend code which would have 3-4 APIs end points.
Initially we will implement them with basic maths or matrix logic.
The task for them would be to replace them with AI logics taught in lectures till now.

So please come up ideas for those 3-4 APIs. Tech stack could be FastAPI i feel. We need to be quick , targeting by saturday.
[11/02, 20:17] Nipun Goyal Sir: @⁨Anirudh algo⁩ also make a doc on how to setup this project and run it for beginners
[11/02, 20:24] Nipun Goyal Sir: i think Readme.ms is enough
[11/02, 20:28] Nipun Goyal Sir: @⁨Anirudh algo⁩ @⁨Harsh Porwal⁩ I feel this would be a really good practice for folks , I want to scale to higher level also, so i am thinking lets give it as assignment after two weeks when we will cover fine tuning , agentic systems and MCPs.

Then we can give it as a 2 week project. That would be interesting.
[11/02, 20:28] Nipun Goyal Sir: Now I am thinking of making an assignment on fine tuning
[11/02, 20:34] Nipun Goyal Sir: i will release it on sunday
[11/02, 20:35] Nipun Goyal Sir: post both lectures on fine tuning
[11/02, 20:35] Nipun Goyal Sir: can you pitch in some ideas regarding that
